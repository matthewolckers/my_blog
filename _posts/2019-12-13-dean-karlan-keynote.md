[Dean Karlan](http://deankarlan.com/) gave one of three keynote addresses at the recent Randomised Control Trial (RCT) Conference at Monash University, organised by [CDES](https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes). Here are some points that stood out to me.

## We all work in our silos
As researchers and policymakers, we focus on our defined area of expertise. But, poverty traps may have many constraints. Dean pushes for a multidimensional approach and common measures across studies to understand the key constraints. For example, the common measures in the 7 microcredit studies were analysed by [Rachel Meager](http://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/people/faculty/rachael-meager) to extract new general insights.


## Graduation model
Referring to [Science paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6236/1260799) where very poor families received several interventions at once.

Comments from Dean:

> Graduation Model not a great name. We are not getting people into middle class, just a spectrum on poverty.

> Chickens did not work well. High risk - high return. Be careful of the asset you choose.

> Pushing against labour model of work vs leisure. Not that simple. Doesn't capture behaviour.

> Cash transfers typically go to consumption and home improvement, and only a small amount to investment.

## Six angsts

1. We punish confusing results.
  - creates a publication bias
  - one solution is JDE pre-results review (paper with blank tables). Power is there, papers get rejected because of power.
2. We do not reward replication enough.
  - huge opportunities through pooled data
3. We expect too much of any one study
  - "Catch 22" Fischer & Karlan
4. We do not spend enough time on data quality
  - Andrew Dillon recruited by Northwestern to work on data quality
5. Operations / implementation key
6. Wasted opportunities with one-off projects
  - one solution: long term panel in Ghana (18 hours of survey per household)
