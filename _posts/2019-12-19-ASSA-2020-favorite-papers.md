I have a tradition of selecting my favorite papers from the massive [ASSA Annual Meeting](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/about). In no particular order, here they are:

[How Do the Rich Think About Redistribution?](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/paper/BKtdtZ2N) by Alain Cohn, Lasse Jessen, Marko Klasjna and Paul Smeets presented at the session titled [Inequality and Distributional Preferences](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/1490).

* With all the talk around wealth taxation, I am interested to hear what rich individuals think about redistribution as they have the most to lose.

[Statistical Non-Significance in Empirical Economics](https://economics.mit.edu/files/14851) by Alberto Abadie presented at the session titled [Treatment Effects and Causal Inference](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/2135).

* Null results can be very useful to shift prior beliefs so don't hide those null results.

[Thousands of Alpha Tests ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X7MsFS8BsyNlRXAIJHOd5IDSXJsoRL9k/view) by Stefano Giglio, Yuan Liao and Dacheng Xiu presented at the session titled [Mutual Funds: New Perspectives](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/2047).

* The battle of active vs passive investment strategies meets multiple-hypothesis testing. Some hedge fund managers can generate alpha.

[Evidence on Expectations of Household Finances ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3362495) by Joao F. Cocco, Francisco Gomes and Paula Lopes presented at the session titled [Learning in Asset Markets](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/1994).

* Super cool data!

[Does the Minimum Wage Affect Child Maltreatment and Parenting Behaviors? A City-level Analysis](hyperlink_to_paper) by Lindsey Bullinger, Kerri Raissian and Will Schneider presented at the session titled [Broadening the Minimum Wage Debate Beyond Employment](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/1323).

* Interesting research program. The other paper in the session "Can Labor Market Policies Reduce Deaths of Despair?" is also very interesting.

[Does Financial Strain Lower Worker Productivity? ](https://economics.mit.edu/files/16997) by Supreet Kaur, Sendhil Mullainathan, Suanna Oh and Frank Schilbach presented at the session titled [Psychology of Poverty: Preferences, Decision-Making and Productivity](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/1879).

* Empirical research on Mullainathan and Shafir's Scarcity model. I know I feel much better getting paid every two weeks rather than monthly.

[Tipping and the Dynamics of Social Norms](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/2103) by Neil Thakral and Linh TÃ´ presented at the session titled [Field Applications and Explorations of Reference-Dependence](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/2103).

* I find it fascinating how tipping norms differ from country to country. Perhaps this paper will give some insights on how tipping norms change.
