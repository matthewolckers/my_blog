When I applied for postdocs, I benefitted from advice that [Julien Combe](https://sites.google.com/site/combeju/home) sent to all PSE students. I have combined that fantastic advice with a few other things I have learnt to compile these tips. 

A massive thank you to [Olamide Ayoade-Alabi](https://olamideayoade-alabi.com/) for taking notes during our chat about postdocs. This blog post is just an edit of her notes.
