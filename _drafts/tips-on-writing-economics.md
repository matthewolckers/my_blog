Dear X, 

I started reading through your article today and the first thing I noticed was the quality of the writing. I found the abstract and introduction very difficult to follow. The sentences are very long and each paragraph makes multiple points. I know you have a clear idea of what it all means, but as the reader, I was lost. To see your article from a reader's perspective, try putting some of the paragraphs into this tool: [http://www.hemingwayapp.com/](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/ "http://www.hemingwayapp.com/")

I know re-writing is a chore but I think your article would benefit a great deal from a substantial rewrite. I am slightly obsessive with writing so please forgive me if this feedback is unwelcome.

  
My go to resources for writing are (in order of most frequent to least frequent use):

* Varanya Chaubey’s [Little Book of Research Writing](http://www.econscribe.org/textbook)
* Deirde McCloskey’s [Economical Writing](https://www.amazon.com/Economical-Writing-Second-Deirdre-McCloskey-ebook/dp/B0058V0M2W)
* Keith Head's [Introduction Formula](http://blogs.ubc.ca/khead/research/research-advice/formula)
* and other resources [listed here]().

I am definitely not a writing expert. If you feel you need help then I suggest reaching out to Andrew Clark. He will do editing for an hourly fee. He edited my first publication. I also convinced Francis to pay an overpriced editor (Professor of Linguistics) to edit an early version of Friend-based Ranking. I think PSE gives you money for that so I suggest making use of it sooner rather than later.

Hope that feedback is helpful. Thanks so much for sharing this early version with me and I look forward to reading the next draft.
